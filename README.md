# Remote-Python-Camera
A project built on Python, OpenCV, and sockets for the purpose of transmitting live video from one computer to another in a way that is easily accessible. It's really not the best. I didn't know how to use multi-threading and locks, so the stream would often crash and the best results were always a bit staticky.
